WP e-Commerce is a Web 2.0 application designed with usability, aesthetics, and presentation in mind. 

== Description ==

The WP e-Commerce shopping cart plugin for WordPress is an elegant easy to use fully featured shopping cart application suitable for selling your products, services, and or fees online.

WP e-Commerce is a Web 2.0 application designed with usability, aesthetics, and presentation in mind. 

Perfect for:

* Bands & Record Labels
* Clothing Companies
* Crafters & Artists
* Books, DVDs & MP3 files 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder 'wp-e-commerce' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

= Updating =

Simply copy the new files across and replace the old files saving saving ones you've modified. If you have product images uploaded then do not overwrite the product_images folder or images folder. If you have downloadable products for sale do not overwrite the files folder.

When updating it is important that you do not overwrite the entire images folder. Instead you should copy over the contents of the new images folder into the existing images folder on your server - saving all the exiting product images you may have already uploaded.

If you experience database errors try de-activating and re-activating your plugin.
